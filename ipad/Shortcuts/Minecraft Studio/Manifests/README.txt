(Do not delete this file...)
• Pack Manifest Generator by TCTalk •
Thank you for using Minecraft Studio!
This folder is the output folder for your previously created manifests, you may have also chosen to save them somewhere else.

To use a manifest file:
Remove the title at the beginning of the file name, so that the final name is simply "manifest.json". Then move it to the root folder of the target pack you are creating. Documentation for creating a pack or Addon for bedrock edition can be found inside Minecraft Studio, downloadable on RoutineHub.
